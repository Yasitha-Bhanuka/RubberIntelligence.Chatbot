        "answer": "Corynespora Leaf Fall (CLF) is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. It is one of the most serious rubber diseases in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Symptoms include fishbone-patterned lesions on leaves, leading to severe defoliation. Young rubber trees (< 5 years) are particularly vulnerable. Control involves planting resistant clones (RRIC 100, RRIC 121), proper spacing for air circulation, and fungicide application (Mancozeb 80% WP) during wet seasons.",

        "answer": "RSS (Ribbed Smoked Sheet) is graded visually according to the Green Book standards. Grades: RSS 1X — clean, dry, no impurities, uniform color (super premium). RSS 1 — slight specks allowed, good quality. RSS 2 — slight rust on surface, minor mould spots. RSS 3 — more discolouration allowed, slight tackiness. RSS 4 — some bark particles, moderate discolouration. RSS 5 — downgraded quality, higher dirt. Sri Lanka traditionally produces high-quality RSS 1 and RSS 2. Proper smoking (48–72 hours at 45–60°C) is critical for quality.",

Prevention: (1) Maintain adequate ammonia levels (>0.70% for HA latex), (2) Keep containers airtight to prevent atmospheric contamination, (3) Ensure all collection cups, buckets, and tanks are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before use, (4) Add latex to storage within 4-6 hours of tapping, (5) Do not mix old residues with fresh latex. If odor develops, test VFA immediately — if > 0.08, the batch may need to be processed quickly before further deterioration.",

Direct contact with iron surfaces causes: (1) Iron ion contamination — Fe²⁺ and Fe³⁺ ions catalyze oxidation of rubber molecules, (2) Dark discolouration of the latex, (3) Reduced mechanical stability (MST), (4) Formation of iron-fatty acid complexes that destabilize the colloid.

For high-performing clones with low TPD susceptibility, S/2 d/3 (every 3rd day) with low Ethephon stimulation (2.5%) is recommended. Virgin bark tapping starts at panel BO-1 (base panel, left side). After bark renewal (6-7 years), retapping can be done on renewed bark. Always tapping from high to low (left to right). Tapping depth should reach 1–1.5 mm above the cambium without damaging it.",

This typically takes 5-7 years from planting depending on the clone, soil, and management. Premature tapping (< 45 cm girth) leads to reduced bark thickness, poor latex flow, and long-term damage to the tree. Some fast-growing clones like RRIC 100 and RRIC 121 can reach tappable girth in 5 years with good management.",

        "answer": "TSR (Technically Specified Rubber) block production: (1) Collect natural coagula (cup lumps, tree lace, slabs), (2) Size reduction using a pre-breaker or hammer mill, (3) Wash and soak the crumbs to remove dirt (multiple water changes), (4) Pass through crepers/shredders to produce fine rubber crumbs, (5) Spread crumbs on trolley trays in 3–4 cm depth, (6) Dry in a hot air dryer at 100–110°C for 3–4 hours until moisture < 0.80%, (7) Compress into 33.3 kg blocks using a hydraulic press, (8) Wrap in polyethylene film and pack into crates (36 blocks per crate = 1.2 MT). Each block is individually sampled and tested for dirt, ash, nitrogen, volatile matter, PRI, and Mooney viscosity.",

        "question": "What is natural rubber made from?",
        "answer": "Natural rubber is made from the latex of the Hevea brasiliensis tree, also known as the Para rubber tree, native to the Amazon rainforest but now grown commercially in tropical regions worldwide. The latex is a milky white fluid produced by specialized cells (laticifers) in the bark. It contains rubber hydrocarbon (cis-1,4-polyisoprene) at 25–35%, plus water, proteins, lipids, sugars, and minerals. Latex flows when the bark is cut (tapped), and the rubber is extracted by coagulation, washing, and drying. Sri Lanka is one of the important natural rubber producers in the world.",

        "question": "What are the main uses of natural rubber?",
        "answer": "Natural rubber is used in: Automotive tires (70–75% of all NR consumption) — NR has superior elasticity, heat dissipation, and adhesion to fabric than synthetic rubber. Medical products — surgical gloves, condoms, catheters (requires high-quality centrifuged latex). Footwear — rubber soles, boots, sandals. Industrial products — conveyor belts, hoses, seals, anti-vibration mounts. Consumer products — rubber bands, erasers, balloons, mattresses (foam). Adhesives — rubber-based contact cement and tapes. Sri Lankan rubber is prized for latex-based products (gloves) and high-quality crepe/sheet rubber.",

        "answer": "Sri Lanka's rubber manufacturing sector produces: Solid tires (industrial, forklift) — a major export earner. Rubber gloves — surgical and examination gloves (latex-based). Rubber mats and flooring — commercial and industrial. Rubber-based footwear — slippers, boots. Auto components — seals, gaskets, bushings. Crepe rubber and RSS — primary processed rubber for export. Centrifuged latex concentrate — exported mainly to glove manufacturers in Malaysia. The Sri Lanka Export Development Board promotes value-added rubber products as a key export sector. The Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka (RRISL) supports industry through research and technology transfer.",

        "question": "How does rubber tapping work?",
        "answer": "Rubber tapping is the process of collecting latex by making a controlled cut in the bark: (1) The tapper makes a thin shaving (1.5mm thick) on the tapping panel using a special tapping knife, (2) The cut follows a half-spiral path at a 30° angle from the horizontal, sloping from upper-left to lower-right, (3) Latex flows from severed laticifer cells in the inner bark into a metal spout fixed at the lower end, (4) It drips into a collection cup (coconut shell or plastic). Tapping is done early morning (5-7 AM) when turgor pressure is highest and temperature is cool. One tapper can tap 350-450 trees per day. The bark regenerates and can be retapped after 6-7 years.",

        "question": "What is Ethephon stimulation in rubber?",
        "answer": "Ethephon (2-chloroethylphosphonic acid, marketed as Ethrel) is a yield stimulant for rubber trees. When applied to the bark near the tapping cut, it releases ethylene gas which: (1) Extends the duration of latex flow after tapping (delays vessel plugging), (2) Increases the latex volume per tapping, (3) Can boost yield by 30-100% depending on clone. Application: 2.5–5% Ethephon mixed with palm oil, applied as a 1cm band on the bark below the tapping cut. Frequency: once per month maximum. Caution: Over-stimulation causes Brown Bast (TPD), so use low concentrations (2.5%) with reduced tapping frequency (d/3 or d/4).",
